# quote-generator-with-vanilla-js
What comes after hello world? A quote generator!

A simple web app made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Fetching JSON format data of quotes from [jacintodesign's Quote API](https://jacintodesign.github.io/quotes-api/data/quotes.json).
- Simple DOM manipulation usage -> dynamically inserting/updating 'textContent's of HTML elements & adding/removing classes to HTML elements.
- A slight effort of responsivity by using CSS media query for smaller screens.

## See it in Action!
